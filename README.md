Download ESM modules from npm and jsdelivr

## Installation

Install this tool using `pip`:

    pip install download-esm

## Warning

This is **alpha software**. It works for downloading Observable Plot, but has not been tested against any other packages yet.

Your help welcome in testing this further!

## Usage

To download Observable Plot and all of its dependencies as EcmaScript modules:

    download-esm @observablehq/plot

This will download around 40 `.js` files to the current directory.

To put them in another directory, add that as an argument:

    download-esm @observablehq/plot ./js

Each file will have any `import` and `export` statements rewritten as relative paths.

You can then use the library in your own HTML and JavaScript something like this:

```html
<div id="myplot"></div>
<script type="module">
import * as Plot from "./js/observablehq-plot-0-6-6-src-index-js.js";
const plot = Plot.rectY(
    {length: 10000}, Plot.binX({y: "count"}, {x: Math.random})
).plot();
const div = document.querySelector("#myplot");
div.append(plot);
</script>
```

## Development

To contribute to this tool, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:

    cd download-esm
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

Now install the dependencies and test dependencies:

    pip install -e '.[test]'

To run the tests:

    pytest
